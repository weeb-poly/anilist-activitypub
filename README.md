# AniList ActivityPub Bridge

GraphQl CodeGen isn't working yet.

The Bridge will be Read-Only (I want to store as little data as possible).

This will not support AniList Activity Replies due to limitations of the AniList API.

Edited + Deleted ActivityPub Actions don't appear to be compatible with the AniList API.
